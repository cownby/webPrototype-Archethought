## Smart Infrastructure & IoT
_Working with the Community to Create Revolutionary Solutions_

Smart Infrastructure is about creating sustainable communities, social heath, better farming & water conservation practices along with healthy economies. Using the Internet of Things like beacons and sensors we can collect large amounts of data that allow us to monitor, change, and develop better ways of living. IoT can be designed for large projects as well as small.

## Technology Meetups

## Brown Bags
Both internally and externally, we hold bring-your-own-lunch and laptop "brown bag" sessions that teach participants something new in bite-sized chunks.
