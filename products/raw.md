Executive Summary
Archethought, founded in 2008, recently pivoted from data science consulting to commercialize micro-location technology, a rapidly growing field mapping indoor human and asset location. The company offers a subscription platform to deliver applications based on micro-location tracking data, using inexpensive, open source sensor hardware. Portions of the technology were developed to support astronaut wellness on the NASA Mars Mission.  

The company is pre-revenue and is developing product fit across several markets, e.g. building information management, retail, security, hospitality, manufacturing, insurance and healthcare providers. The total market is forecast to grow from USD 4.72 Billion in 2016 to USD 23.13 Billion by 2021.  

As an integrated platform that includes both sensors and applications, we believe we are well positioned to quickly discover and exploit applications and installations in one or more of the target markets. We have contacted significant companies in their vertical markets and met with excellent interest. As an example, we are engaged in licensing negotiations with a leading maker of indoor location systems. Within three years we expect to have a significant, rapidly growing business serving global customers.
  
Competitive technologies today fall into event-based, visual and radio wave categories. Event-based technologies capture open/close or walk-by events and provide no track information. Visual technologies attempt to measure human activity in a certain field of view using IP cameras, but provide neither tracks, nor tracks among multiple cameras. Radio wave technologies attempt to manage location events only, such as an emergency beacon, or serve single-purpose, highly localized, high value applications using high cost, RTLS technology. An example RTLS application is to prevent construction workers from falling off elevated platforms. Further, existing systems are not linked to integrated cloud application development platforms. Therefore we believe there are no widely available, inexpensive, general purpose, high accuracy systems, and we believe our deep integration presents a strong and immediate competitive advantage.
  
The company is seeking a $500,000 to complete initial technology development and execute product market fit. To date, the company has already accomplish over nine months of self-funded R&D. We seek funding from the State of Colorado, as we believe the State of Colorado will benefit extensively from the deployment of our platform, in multiple diverse markets and multiple industries. As examples, advancing features and benefits in healthcare, manufacturing and hospitality will greatly increase the reputation of the front range as a source and destination for innovation. Our most likely exit is through a strong licensing deal or sale of the company to an established vendor seeking to extend reach both in technology and market spaces.
  
Archethought consists of deeply experienced engineering and business team members, including multiple members with graduate degrees from CU Boulder, CSU and Notre Dame, as well as experience delivering products and services at companies such as IBM, Compaq and Silicon Valley Bank.
  
The Problem (Q.29)
Micro-location technology locates people and assets inside structures. With 70% or more of our daily lives spent indoors, accurate location mapping provides benefits in a wide variety of industries. Providing inexpensive, yet accurate location mapping has been traditionally difficult. Today's event-based, radio and visual technologies cannot be made cheaply enough while providing the necessary accuracy to make new tracking applications viable.
  
Accuracy is needed to answer questions beyond “entered a room" or "observed advertising." Detailed movement analysis using advanced mathematical models are now capable of behavior detection and prediction. For example, advanced gait analysis can pre-screen aging patients for dementia as they age in their own homes.
  
The problem is to make micro-location systems accurate, easy to install and cheap. Equally important is making accurate data available to an application development platform so innovators may can deliver new apps in this greenfield space. Integrated capture, tracking and application platforms are simply not available with an accessible price point.
  
Retail providers will know much more about customer movement and intentions in-store.
  
Security providers will innovate new trigger based processes and forecast and predict incidents, rather than react to incidents after they occur.
  
Manufacturing users will innovate new time and motion optimizations, while identifying and reducing costly accidents.
  
Hospitality users will deploy new services and applications, for example at conferences where users will interact in new ways with each other.
  
Insurance providers will develop much more accurate behavioral models based on real-world data, saving money while expanding the range of services and products on offer.
  
The Tracking Solution
Archethought has developed an integrated software and hardware platform which locates people and assets with high accuracy and low cost, while offering an easy to use applications development platform at cloud scale. Based on original work measuring astronaut stress levels for future Mars Mission habitats, the system uses open source hardware and cloud based application integration to provide an inexpensive, easy to deploy and easy to use platform.
  
To install and commission the tracking system, users purchase a package of sensors and deploy them in a room. The users purchase a platform login and subscribe. The system self-configures sensor position during initial installation and signals commissioned readiness to the online platform via building network or via subscription m2m network. Beacon tracking data is then delivered to the platform, where our advanced algorithms turn tracking data into usable tracks.
  
To track location, Apple iBeacons, Google Eddystone beacons or Smartphone Apps which emulate beacons “ping” every second, providing the a “radar" return to the sensors. Capturing individual identifiers and “radar" strength on the beacons enables the online platform to calculate the motion tracks with excellent accuracy. The online platform can now deliver the other half of the integrated system value.
  
The Application Platform
The application platform uses lego-block programming to make data analysis faster, easier, more error free and available to a much wider audience. This approach is designed to build on the shoulders of experts, while offering simplicity. For example, a majority of the effort spent on data analytics today involves cleaning and validating data. This is a high-touch, low-value process. Using pre-written building blocks, application development is accomplished for these tasks by the library of common cleaning and validation blocks, freeing users to focus on high-value, low-touch efforts.
  
The online platform is offered as a subscription platform to Free, Standard and Enterprise consumers. Third party integrators sell the sensor packages using the open source hardware, coupled with their own value add. Development of the channel partners to sell the packages will come after significant field expertise has been developed by the Archethought team. Using channel partners will speed the scale out into multiple verticals where Archethought does not have customer marketing.
  
Commercialization Plan & Milestones (Q. 32)
Proof of Principle:
The company has interviewed customers in Retail, Data Science, Indoor Positioning, Insurance and Building. Senior officials confirmed a deep need for this solution today and they would license or purchase a solution today. Discussions with a leading maker of Indoor Positioning systems today revealed they are unable to develop this product, and seek to license our technology.
  
Intellectual Property Protection:
The company will protect it’s proprietary algorithm as a trade secret. The hardware systems are commodity products, and we will use the strategy of “commoditizing the complement” to enable third parties to sell our platform. Our systems products are marked as copyright or trademark where appropriate. Our IP materials are marked Proprietary and Confidential as appropriate.
  
Prototype & Technical Validation:
Technical prototype is completed and function proven. Second prototype is complete and is in mfg software process development. Radios are pre-certified FCC.
