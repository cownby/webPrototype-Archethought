## Problems
To improve services, retail, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing and other industries need accurate in-building location. 
Where should a new product be placed in a retail location? 
Where are the staff during rounds? 
Are employees in dangerous areas?
* Existing solutions are not accurate enough to create actionable data
* It is difficult to create value from closed data without costly expertise
* High capital cost and closed systems discourage deeper innovation

## Solutions
Archethought Shepherd™ uses “internal geo-fences” to know when customers are in a key campaign zone, when nurses visit patients, or when workers enter danger zones. 
You can react instantly to serve customers better, demonstrate regulatory
compliance, and improve safety.
* Sensors are open source, low cost, and easy to deploy
* High accuracy positioning uses smartphones or iBeacons
* Simple, easy to use data processing uses web-based dashboard
