Docker deploys complex, bundled applications using Linux containers. Data Science tools are broadly based across many computer languages, libraries and data management technologies. This makes Docker an important tool to learning, using and deploying Data Science tools at scale.

Docker Installation for Data Science is a screencast showing an opinionated way to install Docker. This installation works to help get going using a variety of Docker images. In future screencasts we can optimize these methods.

Here are some useful links to learn more about Docker tools, VirtualBox and Docker Swarm.
