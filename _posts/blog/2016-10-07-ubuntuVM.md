# Virtual Box setup

I don't set up a virtual machine often enough to remember which options I want, or maybe I just have a poor memory.  Either way, here are steps to create a simple Ubuntu virtual machine with networking.

## Basic Frame


In Oracle VirtualBox, select "New" and answer the prompts as described below.

* Name: Suggest "xxx-os-version". Ex:ample "vb2-ubuntu-16-04-01" or "vm1-ubuntu-16041"
<br /> ![graphic of VirtualBox setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-name.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* Memory Size: Suggest 8192 MB (8 GB) of RAM, or something less that the host machine has.
<br /> ![graphic of VirtualBox setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-ram.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* Hard disk: create a virtual hard disk now
<br /> ![graphic of VirtualBox setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-disk.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* Hard disk file type: VDI
<br /> ![graphic of VirtualBox setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-diskType.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* Disk storage: Dynamically allocated
<br /> ![graphic of VirtualBox setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-diskStorage.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* File location & size: Size by need, and note that Ubuntu needs at least 25 GB. Suggest creating a directory for all things virtual machine and putting the disk file there.

The first time you fire up the virtual machine you will be asked for an operating system file (iso). Download this first and be ready! You can get Ubuntu desktop from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop.  
Follow installation instructions.
Select download updates while installing ubuntu.
<br /> 
![graphic of VirtualBox OS installation dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-installOS1.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}
![graphic of VirtualBox OS installation dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-installOS2.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

For the hostname, suggest "user-vmX", then you know by the name what user is defined. Example: "carolyn-vm4"

## Guest Extensions
These enable cut and paste between host and virtual machine and folder sharing. See 
[http://virtualboxes.org/doc/installing-guest-additions-on-ubuntu/](http://virtualboxes.org/doc/installing-guest-additions-on-ubuntu/)

Open a terminal window and issue the commands:

~~~ bash
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade #(y to prompt or use -y flag; takes a while)
	sudo apt-get install  build-essential  module-assistant #(y to prompt)
	sudo m-a prepare
~~~ 
	
From the running VM window select: 

 * Devices
 * Insert guest additions CD image - 
 * run
 * enter root password

### Seup Copy-Paste
From the running VM window select: Devices - Shared Clipboard - Bi-directional

### Setup a shared folder

* settings on virtualBox dialog or Devices  on current VB window
* shared folders
* add share
* host directory path. ex: C:\Users\COwnby\Documents\VBShare
* name of share, ex: VBShare
* auto mount
* make permanent
* Then from command line: sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf <username>

# Nice things to have

## Java
Seems that java is required for just about everything. Go ahead and install it now.

~~~ bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
echo oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
sudo apt-get install -y oracle-java8-installer
~~~ 

## Python

~~~ bash
sudo apt install python-pip
~~~

# Networking
I am running VirtualBox from Windows 10, and setting up networking so my machine is outside accessible has been tricky. This can be done with a bridged adapter or NAT networking

## Bridged Adapter 
With bridged networking, your virtual machine is seen externally as a normal network device.
For more information, see [Virtual Box Bridged Networking](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged)

Under your VM settings, go to the network tab.

* Attached To: Bridged Adapter
 <br /> ![graphic of Virtual Box Network setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-networkBA1.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}
* Name: is the device showing connectivity from Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections
 <br /> ![graphic of Wondows Network setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-networkBA2.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

##  NAT Networking
An alternative is to use NAT Network with port mapping. A port on the host PC is mapped to each virtual machine, so your VM is externally addressable via the host PC's IP and a port number.
For more information, see [Virtual Box NAT Networking](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat)

You'll first need to get the ip address of your virtual machine with `ip a`.
Under your virtual machine settings network tab, set:

* Attached To: NAT Network
<br /> ![graphic of Virtual Box Network setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-networkNat0.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

Then, in Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager 

* select File - Preferences
<br /> ![graphic of Virtual Box Network setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-networkNat1.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* go to Network tab
* select the screwdriver
<br /> ![graphic of Virtual Box Network setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-networkNat2.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

* select "port forwarding"
<br /> ![graphic of Virtual Box Network setup dialog](https://github.com/Archethought/Archethought.github.io/blob/master/images/posts/VM-networkNat3.png?raw=true){:class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid black"}

To enable ssh access, for example, you might set:

* Host Port = 2222
* Guest IP = virtual machine's IP address from `ip a`
* Guest Port = 22

Then to ssh to the virtual machine, you use

~~~ bash
ssh user@host-ip:2222
~~~
