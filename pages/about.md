	<h2> Our Story </h2>
	<p>
	Archethought offers micro-location solutions, using inexpensive, open source sensor hardware. Portions of the technology were developed to support astronaut wellness on the NASA Mars Mission. 
    An extensive data processing system is hosted in the cloud and available via the web and mobile systems to work with and exploit micro-location data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Micro-location addresses several markets, e.g. building information management, retail, security, hospitality, manufacturing, insurance and healthcare providers. 
    The total market is forecast to grow from USD 4.72 Billion in 2016 to USD 23.13 Billion by 2021.

	Competitive technologies today fall into event-based, visual and radio wave categories. Event-based technologies capture open/close or walk-by events and provide no track information. Visual technologies attempt to measure human activity in a certain field of view using IP cameras, but provide neither tracks, nor tracks among multiple cameras. Radio wave technologies attempt to manage location events only, such as an emergency beacon, or serve single-purpose, highly localized, high value applications using high cost, RTLS technology. An example RTLS application is to prevent construction workers from falling off elevated platforms. Further, existing systems are not linked to integrated cloud application development platforms. Therefore we believe there are no widely available, inexpensive, general purpose, high accuracy systems, and we believe our deep integration presents a strong and immediate competitive advantage.

## FAQ

 <dd class="accordion-navigation">
    <a href="#panel1">Why Micro-location?</a>
    <div id="panel1" class="content">
		<p>Micro-location technology locates people and assets inside structures. With 70% or more of our daily lives spent indoors, accurate location mapping provides benefits in a wide variety of industries. Providing inexpensive, yet accurate location mapping has been traditionally difficult. Today's event-based, radio and visual technologies cannot be made cheaply enough while providing the necessary accuracy to make new tracking applications viable.</p>
  
		<p>Accuracy is needed to answer questions beyond “entered a room" or "observed advertising." Detailed movement analysis using advanced mathematical models are now capable of behavior detection and prediction. For example, advanced gait analysis can pre-screen aging patients for dementia as they age in their own homes.</p>

    <a href="#panel2">What issues does micro-location present?</a>
    <div id="panel2" class="content">
 
		<p>The problem is to make micro-location systems accurate, easy to install and cheap. Equally important is making accurate data available to an application development platform so innovators may can deliver new apps in this greenfield space. Integrated capture, tracking and application platforms are simply not available with an accessible price point.</p>
  
		<ul>
		<li>Retail providers will know much more about customer movement and intentions in-store.</li>
		<li>Security providers will innovate new trigger based processes and forecast and predict incidents, rather than react to incidents after they occur.</li>
		<li>Manufacturing users will innovate new time and motion optimizations, while identifying and reducing costly accidents.</li>
		<li>Hospitality users will deploy new services and applications, for example at conferences where users will interact in new ways with each other.</li>
		<li>Insurance providers will develop much more accurate behavioral models based on real-world data, saving money while expanding the range of services and products on offer.</li>

    <a href="#panel3">How do we track?</a>
    <div id="panel3" class="content">
		<p>Archethought has developed an integrated software and hardware platform which locates people and assets with high accuracy and low cost, while offering an easy to use applications development platform at cloud scale. Based on original work measuring astronaut stress levels for future Mars Mission habitats, the system uses open source hardware and cloud based application integration to provide an inexpensive, easy to deploy and easy to use platform.</p>
  
		<p>To install and commission the tracking system, users purchase a package of sensors and deploy them in a room. The users purchase a platform login and subscribe. The system self-configures sensor position during initial installation and signals commissioned readiness to the online platform via building network or via subscription m2m network. Beacon tracking data is then delivered to the platform, where our advanced algorithms turn tracking data into usable tracks.</p>
  
		<p>To track location, Apple iBeacons, Google Eddystone beacons or Smartphone Apps which emulate beacons “ping” every second, providing the a “radar" return to the sensors. Capturing individual identifiers and “radar" strength on the beacons enables the online platform to calculate the motion tracks with excellent accuracy. The online platform can now deliver the other half of the integrated system value.</p>
